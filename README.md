# Dropins based DSU for Java Servlet 4.0 apps
This project was conceived as a (kind of) reference implementation for [Softalks DSU](https://github.com/softalks/dsu.http) that uses [Apache Felix File Install](https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-file-install.html) to install/uninstall/update OSGi components providing JEE web contexts. You can choose to
* use it to build your WAR in order to have a (dropins based) [DSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_software_updating) enabled web application (like [this one](https://github.com/softalks/dsu.example)) or
* use it as an example to build a DSU solution best suited for your needs
## Atomic updates
To allow atomic updates from the dropins directory you must stop de Apache Felix File Install bundle while the directory is being updated (let's suppose by `wget -m http://host.domain/bundles`). The included Apache Felix [Gogo](https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-gogo.html)/[Web Console](https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-web-console.html) components allows you to start/stop bundles ([programmatically](https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-web-console/web-console-restful-api.html) also) if required
